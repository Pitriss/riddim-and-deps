The answer to IRC’s Eggdrop? Well, not quite, but much like Prosody in the beginning, it’s a solid ground to build on.
It uses Verse, an XMPP client library for Lua. This post will show (mainly for later re-reading) how to setup Riddim.

I assume Lua is present on the device you’re installing Riddim on (e.g. lua5.1 liblua5.1-socket2 liblua5.1-expat0 liblua5.1-sec1 for Debian/Ubuntu etc.).

We need to checkout three projects, assuming they all go into ~/HAL/:

~/HAL/$ hg clone http://code.matthewwild.co.uk/riddim/ riddim
~/HAL/$ hg clone http://code.matthewwild.co.uk/squish/ squish
~/HAL/$ hg clone http://code.matthewwild.co.uk/verse/ verse

From within the Squish folder run:
~/HAL/squish/$ make

This will create an executeable “squish”. You may make it available system-wide by running:
~/HAL/squish/$ sudo make install

Back to our main folder (HAL), you can now squish Verse:
~/HAL/$ ./squish/squish verse/ --use-http

It will create a file called “verse.lua” in our main folder.

Now all that’s left is creating a configuration file for Riddim itself. Name it “config.lua” and also put it into the main folder.
A basic configuration may look like this:

jid = "hal@thiessen.im/bot";
password = "my-really-secure-password";
nick = "HAL";
--debug = true;
command_prefix = "!";

plugins = {

"version",
"ping",
"tell",
"slap",
"groupchat",
"commands",

};

autojoin = {

"test@rooms.thiessen.im"

};

Riddim is started by typing:
~/HAL/$ lua riddim/init.lua
